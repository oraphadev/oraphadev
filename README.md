## Hi there ðŸ¤˜

My name is Raphael Lima and I'm a Brazilian software developer and a Database student at FATEC.

I love to work with Vue, React and Laravel. I also have some experience with GraphQL, Node, CodeIgniter, MongoDB, among others. Currently working as an fullstack developer at GÃ¡lata with Laravel and MySQL.
